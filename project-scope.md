# Brief and Objectives 
## Project Brief
TO REDEVLOP THE CURRENT CANDIDATE ZONE TO IMPROVE SECURITY, PROCESSES, UPDATES

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves the design and development of a new version of the candidate zone. This will involve improving functionality and streamlining existing services offered. There will also be a requirement for data integration between external 3rd party systems.

The candidate zone portal will seek to place itself in a highly expanding and competitive market of recruitment solutions. The site will offer the ability to screen candidates, providen interactive testing capability, dynamic forms, screening, contracts, reporting. The may be requirment for human resource to be decided. PDF Reports.

The candidate zone will require an SEO strategy and the implementation of analytic's so that campaign effect and performance can be monitored. The e-commerce site needs the ability to publish automatically to social media channels and established online market places. Marketplaces, analytics, and social media must be centralised to allow automatic functionality and also be simple to use with a requirement to enable multiple users to contribute depending on access level.

The candidate zone needs to have the ability to white label. Ideally with seperate domains.

The candidate zone site needs to have the ability to accept user generated submissions, this will generally be in the form of uploads of documents. The documents will contain highly sensitive information and therefore needs encryption and highest security standards for storage. Any user generated submissions needs to ability for the relevant people to be notified.

### High Level Technical Requirements    
  * Candidate Forms
  * Screening Forms
  * Candidate Tests
  * Mobile Application (ALF)
  * Printers
  * Live Chat
 
  
#### Candidate Forms

The ability to create, manage and assign forms. The creation of forms will include a version of form builder built on existing format. This will include the creation of form pages, sections and elements.  

The forms will need to include the ability to add standard features such as conditional logic based on a form response.

The form will need to have the ability to add special features such as 
Calender Verification

There will be more feature requests so this will need the flexability to customise 

PDF Report generation of response with the flexability to incorporate client branding and design


__SUB HEADING__


__SUB HEADING__  
To use any 3rd party print services you will most likely need to set the report in a print template to incorporate print requirments for machines, it may differ by printer/machines. The print layout may be a diffent to any standard generated PDF layout. The printer will also require the report document to have even page numbers usually divisable by 4. Report pages may not be a standard number due to unique information contained. Therefore additional blank pages will need to be added to the document to achieve the correct page count. Any PDF generating software will need adaptable enough to include templates. A further consinderation will need to be made for reports (PDF) provided via 3rd party to enable processing and preparing the document for print when uploaded. The other option is that the printer sets the page count and template for report(s) which will incur a cost each time.

 </p>
  
#### Screening Forms

Screening forms will be based on the standard form process. The diference with screening forms is that the form will be processed by internal staff

__Method 1:__ The 3rd party provides us with the physical report: There will be some structure to process that the 3rd party will be informed of, mainly the external provider will upload the document via ALIVE system. Details of report provided will be discussed resolution, page layout, file size, delivery options. A simple system is created that notifies the 3rd party when a report is required, who the customer is and requirements and what date the expected sample/data is received or required. This will presumably be via email and additional elements may also be included in the email body or further emails sent. Contained within the email body will be a link to submit the report when complete, this link can be generated to incorporate important information required by ALIVE customer, document type and document storage. This link will have access for the 3rd party to upload the document, preferably without needing to login. On upload the document will be encrypted, stored in appropriate place and be prepared for moderation. The relevant moderator will notified that the document is ready. The document will then be easily approved by the moderator. Once approved the customer will have access to the document and receive notification via email. The document may need to be processed accordingly to suit print requirements.

__Method 2:__ The 3rd party will provide to some form of API or Gateway. The details of the API will differ with provider, therefore using this method will involve some custom work for each client to initiate data integration between systems. The report will be dynamically generated created based on the process we will use for internal reports. The moderator will be notified, the moderator will have the ability to approve. Once approved the customer will have access to the document and receive notification via email.

Storage file types and delivery options mainly method 1 need to be reviewed in detail. Content Delivery Network, AWS?

 </p>

#### Candidate Tests  
Candidate tests will be based in intial design functionalitly of forms

Questions will need to be able to be formatted ideally with a WYSIWG editor.

Questions will take the form of text images and video.

##### Mobile Application ALF

There will be a need for synchronisation between both ALF and ALIVE. This will involve subscriptions, product sales, booking schedules, surveys and reports.

##### Printers  

Ideally the report printing will be handled externally with automated process managed internally or connected externally. Some considerations required by print operators

- Report resolution (3rd Party may be providing)
- Setting report in print template
- Additional print pages added to report (printers require total page count to be divided by 4 so blank pages need inserting accordingly)  
- Secure file transfer options
- Security & GDPR
- Print scheduling, accurate lead times to customer
- Estimated print numbers
- Timescales for go live - usually to incorporate practice print run and testing.

Short-term may require printing to be handled internally so any print management console needs to be robust to accommodate internal printing and different external print providers.

##### Live Chat

The system will have a live chat feature which will notify the end user when staff are online and offline. The live chat will have the ability for end user and staff to communicate directly. Chat logs will be recorded for any further investigation or requests.  


### PROJECT TASKS

__1. Determine System Framework__  
Decide which architecture will used and give future proof etc etc. The options that have been considered are self hosted e-commerce - magento, external hosted shopify. There is now further consideration on using a complete framework options are, codeignitor, NodeJS and Laravel.  
__2. Setup Working Environments__  
I would initially propose to have 3 working environments. This would involve a Development Environment (DEV), a Staging Environment (STAGE) and a Live Environment (LIVE). All this environments should have a repository for version control in place. All initial development would take place in the DEV environment, when ready the work would move to the STAGE environment for more rigorous and thorough testing. Once the testing is complete and we have had the sign off that testing is complete and satisfactory, it would then move to the LIVE environment. If any problems are encountered at any point, work would move back to the DEV environment and then once again moved to STAGE for testing. Nothing would move to LIVE until everyone is completely happy for this to proceed.  
__3. Core Functionality and Internal Integration__  
Design and develop the key aspects that will be used for the core functionality of the site. Install e-commerce framework. Link LIFO reports with appropriate branding.  
__4. Site Design and Content Entry__  
Once the site design is completed and signed off, content provided to us will be entered onto the site pages. This will include text and pictures for each page to be created with the initial setup, along with meta data.  
__5. Develop External Integration__   
External reports, distribution and shipping and Printing  
__6. Checkout Payment Integration__  
Multiple payment options will be setup including Paypal, GoCardless and others to be confirmed. The entire shop experience shall be fully tested from general browsing through to product selection, checkout purchase and delivery notification.  
__7. Browser and Compatibility Testing__  
The site will be tested to make sure it works with a wide selection of browsers and to ensure it does not break when viewed on mobile devices or tablets.  
__8. Data Collection__  
A data collection pop-up invitation to the general mailing list as well as auto cart abandonment detection, general marketing and surveys. contact email and forms will be set up and tested.  

## Deliverables and Components

### Deliverables
1. Build Core Functionality  
We will need to prioritise building the e-commerce and LIFO reporting as urgent. Other features need the ability to be switched on and off when required as the project progresses.
2. E-commerce site Design  
Following the design being sent by the designer, one round of editing will be allowed before digital sign off is required to move forward to building the site.
3. Report/Email/Marketing branding needs to be appropriate to ALIVE and its products/services
4. Ensure shipping and printing is working correctly  .
5. Draft version of site, once all relevant content for the site we have been provided and applicable feature built this will be loaded in and testing can begin. Digital sign off will be required before deploying to the Live Site.
6. Final version of site
Relevant training will be conducted on features of site. 
7. Report building process reviewed, appointment booking and live feeds developed. Further integration with internal and external systems.

### Components

Component 1 | E-commerce User Account and Profile(s)  
Accounts can be created by registration or created manually, further access to other features like user, group and product management will be determined by user access levels.

Component 2 | Site Backup & Security  
A hard backup copy of the files associated with the site will be delivered on completion to the client on a memory stick, as well as backed up to appropriate secure location(s). Where appropriate the most secure encryption methods will be used.

Component 3 | Training Documents  
A reference document outlining how to make updates to the site along with a link to online resources will be built as project develops.
